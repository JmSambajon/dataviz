9.1.4 - SQLite can be run on a phone. No secirity.

9.1.5
To experiment with the sqlite file path I put my file in a Resources directory and changed the URL
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Resources/hawaii.sqlite")
NOTE that if the file does not exist yet, it will be created.

Base.classes gives us access to all the classes.
keys() references all the names of the classes.

9.2.4
Had to rotate the x axis labels
df.plot(rot=90)

9.2.5

  1. Mean: the average, which you can find by adding up all the numbers in a dataset and dividing by the number of numbers.
  2. Variance: how far a set of numbers is from the average.
  3. Standard deviation: a measure of how spread out numbers in a dataset are; the square root of the variance.
  4. Minimum: the smallest number in a dataset.
  5. Maximum: the largest number in a dataset.
  6. Percentiles: where the number is in relation to the rest of the set of data.
  7. Count: the total number of numbers or items in a dataset.
  
SQLite get table column names:

Measurement = Base.classes.measurement
['id', 'station', 'date', 'prcp', 'tobs']

Station.__table__.columns.keys()
['id', 'station', 'name', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'elevation']

## PYTHON __main__
import app

print("example __name__ = %s", __name__)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("example is being run directly.")
else:
    print("example is being imported")
